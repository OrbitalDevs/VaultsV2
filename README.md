# VaultsV2

# Orbital

Orbital is a Solidity project that allows users to create and manage secure vaults, known as "Funds", composed of various tokens such as WBTC, ETH, USDC, PAXG, and more. The user who creates the fund becomes the "Fund Manager" and can trade among the tokens to manage depositors' money efficiently. The depositors can withdraw their funds at any time, while the Fund Manager can only trade tokens within the fund and cannot withdraw tokens they did not deposit themselves. The smart contracts are designed to run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) or compatible networks.
